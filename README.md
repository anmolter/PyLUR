## Usage
A Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models.
## Instructions
XLUR was specifically developed as a toolbox for use within the ArcGIS Pro (v2.2.4 or higher, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA) software. To use XLUR the following steps are recommended:
1. Clone or download the XLUR repository to a local drive. Avoid having spaces in the file path to the directory where you are storing the XLUR repository. 
2. <a href="https://anmolter.github.io/XLUR/XLUR_documentation.html"> Click here </a> to open the user manual in your web browser. Alternatively, you can open the manual that is stored in the XLUR repository: \\XLUR\\XLUR\\Code\\Documentation\\XLUR_documentation.html . This will open the XLUR Wizard manual in a standard web browser. The manual contains the documentation for the XLUR tools and a tutorial section, which guides the user through a test run of XLUR.
3. Follow the instructions in the manual to install XLUR and to launch the tools.
