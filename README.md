## Instructions
XLUR was specifically developed as a toolbox for use within the ArcGIS Pro (v2.2.4 or higher, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA) software. To use XLUR the following steps are recommended:
1. Clone or download the XLUR repository to a local drive. Avoid having spaces in the file path to the directory where you are storing the XLUR repository. 
2. In the XLUR repository open the XLUR folder and doubleclick XLUR_documentation_Shortcut. This will open the XLUR Wizard manual in a standard web browser. The manual contains the documentation for the XLUR tools and a tutorial section, which guides the user through a test run of XLUR. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://anmolter.github.io/XLUR/XLUR_documentation.pdf" type="application/pdf"> click here </a> to open a pdf version of the user manual in your web browser.
