# PyLUR
A Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models.
## Instructions
PyLUR was specifically developed as a toolbox for use within the ArcGIS Pro (v2.2.4 or higher, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA) software. 
1. Download the PyLUR.zip folder (this ensures that the help file dependencies will work), unzip it and store it on a local drive. This folder contains the PyLUR ArcGIS Project File, which can be opened in the ArcGIS Pro. It also contains the manual, the Python code, and help files associated with PyLUR tools. 
2. Open the PyLUR folder and doubleclick PyLUR_Manual_BrowserFriendly - Shortcut. This will open the PyLUR Wizard manual in a standard web browser. 
3. Follow the instructions in the manual to install PyLUR and to launch the tools.
