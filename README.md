# PyLUR
## Usage
A Python toolbox for ArcGIS Pro that enables the development and application of land use regression models.
## Instructions
PyLUR was specifically developed as a toolbox for use within the ArcGIS Pro (v2.2.4 or higher, Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Redlands, CA) software. To use PyLUR the following steps are recommended:
1. Clone or download the PyLUR repository to a local drive. Avoid having spaces in the file path to the directory where you are storing the PyLUR repository. 
2. In the PyLUR repository open the PyLUR folder and doubleclick PyLUR_Manual_BrowserFriendly - Shortcut. This will open the PyLUR Wizard manual in a standard web browser. The manual contains the documentation for the PyLUR tools and a tutorial section, which guides the user through a test run of PyLUR. 
3. Follow the instructions in the manual to install PyLUR and to launch the tools.
